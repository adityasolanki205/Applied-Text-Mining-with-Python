# Applied Machine Learning in Python
 
This course is introduction to text mining and text manipulation basics. The course helped in understanding of how text is handled by python, the structure of text both to the machine and to humans, and an overview of the nltk framework for manipulating text. The second week focused on common manipulation needs, including regular expressions (searching for text), cleaning text, and preparing text for use by machine learning processes. The third week included applicaiton of basic natural language processing methods to text, and demonstrate how text classification is accomplished. The final week included more advanced methods for detecting the topics in documents and grouping them by similarity (topic modelling). 

In this repository all the required files are present to perform all the text manipulation. All the items are defined as below
